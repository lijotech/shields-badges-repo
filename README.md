# Shields.io Badges Demo

Badges from shields.io are great visual aids for displaying useful information about a Git repository. They help make your repository more appealing and informative at a glance. Let me explain everything in parts:

## Common Tags for Git Repositories
Badges often use the following tags to convey information:

### Build Status 
Indicates whether the latest build is passing or failing.

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)

### License
Shows the license type of your project.

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

### Version
Displays the current version of the project.

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)

### Dependencies
Highlights whether project dependencies are up-to-date.

![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-up%20to%20date-brightgreen)

### Code Coverage

## Types of Badges

- **Static Badges**: They display fixed text or data, independent of any external system.

    Example: A "Hello World" badge:

    ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/hello-world-brightgreen)

- **Dynamic Badges**: They fetch real-time data from APIs or external systems. For example:

    Build status fetched dynamically from GitHub Actions:

    ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/lijotech/site-weframes/azure-static-web-apps-happy-sky-007ec6f1e.yml)
